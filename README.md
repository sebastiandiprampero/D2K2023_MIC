Machine Learning Approach to Predicting Thermodilution Cardiac Output

Patients within a hospital cardiac intensive care unit experience high mortality rates due to sudden changes in heart condition. Healthcare workers’ current solution is to monitor patients’ cardiac output (blood pumped by the heart per minute), which requires a painful, expensive, and invasive procedure to measure. Together with Medical Informatics Corp, we aim to mitigate these costs by utilizing time series and signal processing methods to predict cardiac output with less invasive measurements e.g. electrocardiogram and arterial blood pressure waves.

Below is a link to my team's poster that describes our process and findings for this project:
